Python Utilities
================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MasterOdin/python-utils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MasterOdin/python-utils)

This repo holds a python package that houses various utilities that
I've used in various projects and that I'd rather not rewrite/find
repeatidly everytime I need them. Some of the functions could be
replaced with something like Scipy, but I'd rather not bring in that
dependency if the only thing I needed out of it was conversion of
celsisus to farenheit. As such a key component of the library is to
minimize the dependencies on other libraries such that one could
drop this into any project with minimal fuss.
